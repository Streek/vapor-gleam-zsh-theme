# Gleam ZSH Theme

A stylish ZSH theme inspired by the official [Gleam language](https://gleam.run/) website and branding.  
Designed for developers who love colorful, friendly interfaces with legible, modern vibes.  
Works best with a dark terminal and the [Fira Code Retina](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, at least that's what I run it with.
